Narration,Narrative,A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
Narration,Narrative,are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
Narration,Narrative,The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
Narration,Narrative,impression of sky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"One of the boxes has a children's illustrated ""WANTED"""
Narration,Narrative,poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The

Narration,Narrative,that safe!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
Narration,Narrative,"""BANK"" box."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head kisses the coins.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
Narration,Narrative,(kissing noises)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought"
Narration,Narrative,into the scene.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old"
Narration,Narrative,potato!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get"
Narration,Narrative,run over!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Narration,Narrative,Hot Wheels track loop.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do"
Narration,Narrative,something!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene"
Narration,Narrative,opposite the inanimate spud.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Reach for the sky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Are you gonna come quietly?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
Narration,Narrative,brought my attack dog with a built-
Narration,Narrative,in force field!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in"
Narration,Narrative,front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who"
Narration,Narrative,eats force field dogs!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the"
Narration,Narrative,Slinky Dog.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"You're goin' to jail, Bart."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
Narration,Narrative,in the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word ""JAIL"""
Narration,Narrative,written in crayon.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Say good-bye to the wife and
Narration,Narrative,tatertots.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr."
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
Narration,Narrative,"pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,"
Narration,Narrative,forcing some of his parts loose.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the"
Narration,Narrative,floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pulling Woody's string)
Narration,Narrative,"You saved the day again, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You're my favorite deputy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"SONG ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME"" plays while Andy does"
Narration,Narrative,various activities with Woody:
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
Narration,Narrative,drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Narration,Narrative,Woody is lassoing the cattle.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
Narration,Narrative,"car, and herds the remaining ""cow"" boxes under Molly's crib."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
Narration,Narrative,allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
Narration,Narrative,catches him at the bottom.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
Narration,Narrative,and around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(raising his arms)
Narration,Narrative,Score!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
Narration,Narrative,his mother.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wow!  Cool!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Whadda ya think?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just"
Narration,Narrative,finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
Narration,Narrative,"banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: ""Happy"
Narration,Narrative,"Birthday Andy."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
Narration,Narrative,decorations.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, sure, we can leave it up."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yeah!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
Narration,Narrative,going to be here any minute.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Okay.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"It's party time, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
Narration,Narrative,at her.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Howdy, Little Lady!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
Narration,Narrative,time.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(picking up Molly)
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting"
Narration,Narrative,heavy!
Narration,Narrative,(to Woody)
Narration,Narrative,"See ya later, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy exits.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his"
Narration,Narrative,expression changing from a smile to worry.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,Pull my string!  The birthday
Narration,Narrative,party's today?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody thinks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to the room)
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the"
Narration,Narrative,"closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits"
Narration,Narrative,himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
Narration,Narrative,Ages three and up!  I'm not
Narration,Narrative,supposed to be babysitting Princess
Narration,Narrative,Drool.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin"
Narration,Narrative,slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
Narration,Narrative,are in the wrong slots.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!"
Narration,Narrative,I don't get it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hamm walks away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You uncultured swine!
Narration,Narrative,(to someone O.S.)
Narration,Narrative,"What are you looking at, ya hockey"
Narration,Narrative,puck?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
Narration,Narrative,"He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on"
Narration,Narrative,the night stand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(saluting)
Narration,Narrative,Sir!  No Sir!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, thank you.  At ease."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody hops off the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Slinky?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Right here, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing"
Narration,Narrative,out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
Narration,Narrative,the board.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'm red this time.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, Slink --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh...well alright, you can be red"
Narration,Narrative,if you want.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad"
Narration,Narrative,news.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Bad news?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in"
Narration,Narrative,the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering)
Narration,Narrative,Just gather everyone up for a staff
Narration,Narrative,meeting and be happy!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Got it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky shuffles off.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Be HAPPY!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
Narration,Narrative,ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to the room)
Narration,Narrative,"Staff meeting, everybody."
Narration,Narrative,(aside)
Narration,Narrative,"Snake, Robot -- podium duty."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
Narration,Narrative,follow Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other"
Narration,Narrative,direction.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey Etch!  Draw!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch"
Narration,Narrative,etches a gun on its screen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pretending to be shot)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've"
Narration,Narrative,been working on that draw.  Fastest
Narration,Narrative,knobs in the west.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Got a staff meeting, you guys, come"
Narration,Narrative,"on, let's go!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Narration,Narrative,Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,"
Narration,Narrative,who moved my doodle pad way over here?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
Narration,Narrative,walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(unaffected)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, how ya doin', Rex?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex suddenly turns timid.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I was close to being scared that time.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I'm going for fearsome here, but I"
Narration,Narrative,just don't feel it.  I think I'm
Narration,Narrative,just coming off as annoying.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
Narration,Narrative,"PEEP, the porcelain figurine."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(choking)
Narration,Narrative,"Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I wanted to thank you, Woody, for"
Narration,Narrative,saving my flock.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(blushing)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, hey - it was nothing."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Whadda ya say I get someone else to
Narration,Narrative,watch the sheep tonight?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(very flustered)
Narration,Narrative,"Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of"
Narration,Narrative,ABC blocks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Remember, I'm just a couple of"
Narration,Narrative,blocks away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is left lovestruck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up"
Narration,Narrative,front.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Woody!  C'mon!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
Narration,Narrative,"MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and"
Narration,Narrative,indicates his microphone.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ahem!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(grabbing microphone)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, thanks, Mike."
Narration,Narrative,(to the crowd)
Narration,Narrative,Okay --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Mike)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, whoa, step back --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
Narration,Narrative,Everybody hear me?  Up on the
Narration,Narrative,"shelf, can you hear me?  Great!"
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, first item today...oh, yeah."
Narration,Narrative,Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all MOAN.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Well I didn't know we were supposed
Narration,Narrative,to have one already.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(waving his arm out
Narration,Narrative,its socket)
Narration,Narrative,Do we have to hold hands?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a"
Narration,Narrative,big joke.  We've only got one week
Narration,Narrative,left before the move.  I don't want
Narration,Narrative,any toys left behind.  A moving
Narration,Narrative,"buddy -- if you don't have one, get"
Narration,Narrative,one!
Narration,Narrative,(checking the pad)
Narration,Narrative,"Alright, next...uh...oh, yes."
Narration,Narrative,"Tuesday night's ""Plastic Corrosion"
Narration,Narrative,"Awareness"" meeting was, I think, a"
Narration,Narrative,big success and we want to thank Mr.
Narration,Narrative,Spell for putting that on for us.
Narration,Narrative,"Thank you, Mr. Spell."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The words ""You're welcome"" scroll across Mr. Spell's display"
Narration,Narrative,screen as he speaks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You're welcome.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note"
Narration,Narrative,here...
Narration,Narrative,(under his breath)
Narration,Narrative,Andy's birthday party's been moved
Narration,Narrative,to today.
Narration,Narrative,(full voice)
Narration,Narrative,Next we have --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all PANIC.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's"
Narration,Narrative,today?!  His birthday's not 'til
Narration,Narrative,next week!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What's going on down there?  Is Mom
Narration,Narrative,losing her marbles?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, obviously she wanted to have"
Narration,Narrative,the party before the move.  I'm not
Narration,Narrative,worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Of course Woody ain't worried!
Narration,Narrative,He's been Andy's favorite since
Narration,Narrative,kindergarten!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!"
Narration,Narrative,"If Woody says it's all right, then,"
Narration,Narrative,"well, darnit, it's good enough for"
Narration,Narrative,me.  Woody has never steered us
Narration,Narrative,wrong before.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and"
Narration,Narrative,mimes kissing his own butt.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and"
Narration,Narrative,birthday we go through this.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,But what if Andy gets another
Narration,Narrative,dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
Narration,Narrative,don't think I can take that kind of
Narration,Narrative,rejection.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, listen, no one's getting"
Narration,Narrative,replaced.  This is Andy we're
Narration,Narrative,talking about.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,It doesn't matter how much we're
Narration,Narrative,played with.  What matters is that
Narration,Narrative,we're here for Andy when he needs
Narration,Narrative,us.  That's what we're made for.
Narration,Narrative,Right?
Narration,Narrative,"Everyone is now looking down, sheepish."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
Narration,Narrative,"staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!"
Narration,Narrative,Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Stay calm, everyone!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
Narration,Narrative,"the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, meeting adjourned."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get"
Narration,Narrative,a peek outside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at"
Narration,Narrative,all those presents?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I can't see a thing!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out"
Narration,Narrative,of his head and holds them up over the other toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yessir, we're next month's garage"
Narration,Narrative,sale fodder for sure.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(panicked)
Narration,Narrative,Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ah, for crying out loud, they're"
Narration,Narrative,"all in boxes, you idiot!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The presents keep coming.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They're getting bigger.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait!  There's a nice little one
Narration,Narrative,over there!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but"
Narration,Narrative,then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
Narration,Narrative,toys SCREAM.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Spell the word ""trashcan."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We're doomed!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in"
Narration,Narrative,surrender.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Alright!  Alright!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"If I send out the troops, will you"
Narration,Narrative,all calm down?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, save your batteries!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using"
Narration,Narrative,the old noodle.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
Narration,Narrative,the nightstand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sargent.  Establish a recon post
Narration,Narrative,downstairs.  Code red.  You know
Narration,Narrative,what to do.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes SIR!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The green army man hops down to the floor where a ""BUCKET O'"
Narration,Narrative,"SOLDIERS"" sits."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Alright men, you heard him.  Code"
Narration,Narrative,Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
Narration,Narrative,Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
Narration,Narrative,Let's move move move!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
Narration,Narrative,formation across the bedroom floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
Narration,Narrative,"to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for"
Narration,Narrative,the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
Narration,Narrative,hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
Narration,Narrative,hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
Narration,Narrative,below through his binoculars.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway"
Narration,Narrative,rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the"
Narration,Narrative,living room.  It's almost time for
Narration,Narrative,the presents.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the"
Narration,Narrative,Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting"
Narration,Narrative,down to the floor below.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,"
Narration,Narrative,"then give the ""all clear"" sign."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
Narration,Narrative,the receiving half of the baby monitor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,And this --
Narration,Narrative,(turning on the baby monitor)
Narration,Narrative,-- is how we find out what is in
Narration,Narrative,those presents.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The green army men march in formation across the floor when
Narration,Narrative,suddenly...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
Narration,Narrative,door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
Narration,Narrative,in their various classic action poses.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the"
Narration,Narrative,chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
Narration,Narrative,Barbeque --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
Narration,Narrative,of a soldier.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,"
Narration,Narrative,I thought I told him to pick these up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of"
Narration,Narrative,her path and continues on to the living room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Shouldn't they be there by now?
Narration,Narrative,What's taking them so long?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, these guys are professionals."
Narration,Narrative,"They're the best.  C'mon, they're"
Narration,Narrative,not lying down on the job.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to"
Narration,Narrative,proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
Narration,Narrative,living room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
Narration,Narrative,drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Narration,Narrative,Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(moans)
Narration,Narrative,Go on without me.  Just go!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A good soldier never leaves a man
Narration,Narrative,behind.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
Narration,Narrative,"themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once"
Narration,Narrative,"downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the"
Narration,Narrative,houseplant.  Suddenly...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps"
Narration,Narrative,and kid clamor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,"
Narration,Narrative,right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
Narration,Narrative,conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
Narration,Narrative,children run by.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates"
Narration,Narrative,"the wounded soldier and gives the ""thumb's up"" signal."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
Narration,Narrative,coffee table.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,There they are.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
Narration,Narrative,monitor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha"
Narration,Narrative,Bravo.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"This is it!  This is it!  Quiet,"
Narration,Narrative,"quiet, quiet!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Come in, Mother Bird."
Narration,Narrative,Alright...Andy's opening the first
Narration,Narrative,present now.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(chanting)
Narration,Narrative,Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato
Narration,Narrative,Head...Mrs. Potato Head...
Narration,Narrative,(off Rex's look)
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, I can dream, can't I?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,The bow's coming off...he's ripping
Narration,Narrative,the wrapping paper...it's
Narration,Narrative,a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've
Narration,Narrative,"got a lunchbox, here!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A lunchbox?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A lunchbox...?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,For lunch.  Heh heh heh...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Ok, second present...it appears to"
Narration,Narrative,"be...okay, it's bed sheets."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Who invited THAT kid?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
MATCH DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, only one left."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, we're on the last present now..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Last present!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,It's a big one...It's a...it's a
Narration,Narrative,boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship --
Narration,Narrative,"Battleship, the boardgame!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, alright!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,"
Narration,Narrative,sending his facial features flying.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, watch it!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sorry there, old Spudhead."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to army men)
Narration,Narrative,"Mission accomplished.  Well done,"
Narration,Narrative,"men.  Pack it up, we're going home."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to
Narration,Narrative,worry about.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I knew you were right all along,"
Narration,Narrative,Woody.  Never doubted you for a
Narration,Narrative,second.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we"
Narration,Narrative,have here?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mrs. Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
Narration,Narrative,another large present.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(indicating the baby monitor)
Narration,Narrative,Wait -- turn that thing back on!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Come in, Mother Bird, come in,"
Narration,Narrative,Mother Bird.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the toys tense up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Mom has pulled a surprise present
Narration,Narrative,from the closet.  Andy's opening it...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's really excited about this one.
Narration,Narrative,It's a huge package.  Oh -- get
Narration,Narrative,out -- one of the kids is in the
Narration,Narrative,"way, I can't see..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(from monitor)
Narration,Narrative,...it's...it's a --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The sound of children CHEERING emits from the monitor,"
Narration,Narrative,cutting off the Sargent.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the"
Narration,Narrative,monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
Narration,Narrative,to roll out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never"
Narration,Narrative,know what it is!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(sarcastic)
Narration,Narrative,"Way to go, Rex."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  Potato Head tries to
Narration,Narrative,correctly insert the batteries.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em"
Narration,Narrative,around!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Plus is positive, minus is negative!"
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, let me!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato
Narration,Narrative,Head aside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Let's go to my room, guys!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The kids rush past the houseplant.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into the monitor)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody puts the last battery back in.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,There.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat!
Narration,Narrative,Resume your positions NOW!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to"
Narration,Narrative,your places.  Hurry!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys PANIC and scatter about the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?
Narration,Narrative,Did you see my ear?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Outta my way!  Here I come, here I"
Narration,Narrative,come --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Everyone scurries to their places as the KIDS' FOOTSTEPS
Narration,Narrative,grow louder.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
Narration,Narrative,feet rush in.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, look!  His lasers light up."
Narration,Narrative,"Take that, Zurg!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down"
Narration,Narrative,the gap between the bed and the back wall.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Quick!  Make a space!  This is
Narration,Narrative,where the spaceship lands.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- and you press his back and he
Narration,Narrative,does a karate-chop action!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Come on down, guys.  It's time for"
Narration,Narrative,games!  We've got prizes!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE"
Narration,Narrative,DOOR behind them.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What is it?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can you see it?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What the heck is up there?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
Narration,Narrative,to discover him there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody, what are you doing under the"
Narration,Narrative,bed?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(composing himself)
Narration,Narrative,"Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing."
Narration,Narrative,I'm sure Andy was just a little
Narration,Narrative,"excited, that's all.  Too much cake"
Narration,Narrative,"and ice cream, I suppose.  It's"
Narration,Narrative,just a mistake.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in"
Narration,Narrative,"your spot, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Have you been replaced?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?
Narration,Narrative,No one is getting replaced.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys give each other a look of doubt.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Now let's all be polite, and give"
Narration,Narrative,"whatever it is up there a nice, big"
Narration,Narrative,"""Andy's Room"" welcome."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the"
Narration,Narrative,edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
Narration,Narrative,"action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head"
Narration,Narrative,"to toe.  The imposing ""G.I. Joe-sized"" doll stands heroically"
Narration,Narrative,"in the center of the bed, his back to Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody GULPS.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz comes alive and looks around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While he scans the bedroom a ""DARTH VADER"" LIKE BREATHING is"
Narration,Narrative,heard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Narration,Narrative,"Come in, Star Command."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nothing.  He pushes the button again.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Star Command - come in.  Do you
Narration,Narrative,read me?
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,Why don't they answer?!!
Narration,Narrative,"Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The"
Narration,Narrative,box is designed to look like a spaceship.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,My ship!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
Narration,Narrative,wrist communicator.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
Narration,Narrative,Stardate 4072: My ship has run off
Narration,Narrative,course en route to sector 12.  I've
Narration,Narrative,crash landed on a strange planet.
Narration,Narrative,The impact must have awoken me from
Narration,Narrative,hyper-sleep.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into communicator)
Narration,Narrative,Terrain seems a bit unstable...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into communicator)
Narration,Narrative,No read-out yet if the air is
Narration,Narrative,breathable... and there seems to be
Narration,Narrative,no sign of intelligent life
Narration,Narrative,anywhere --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's face suddenly pops into view.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hello-o-o...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance.  He presses a"
Narration,Narrative,"button on his arm that turns on a red ""laser beam"" light on"
Narration,Narrative,his wrist.  Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and
Narration,Narrative,holds it there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I"
Narration,Narrative,frighten you?  Didn't mean to.
Narration,Narrative,Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody
Narration,Narrative,and this is Andy's room.  That's
Narration,Narrative,"all I wanted to say, and also,"
Narration,Narrative,there has been a bit of a mix-up.
Narration,Narrative,"This is my spot, see, the bed here --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on"
Narration,Narrative,Woody's vest.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(de-activating his
Narration,Narrative,laser beam)
Narration,Narrative,Local law enforcement!  It's about
Narration,Narrative,time you got here.  I'm Buzz
Narration,Narrative,"Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe"
Narration,Narrative,Protection Unit.  My ship has crash
Narration,Narrative,landed here by mistake.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation."
Narration,Narrative,Woody tries to keep up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yes, it is a mistake, because, you"
Narration,Narrative,"see, the bed, here, is my spot."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I need to repair my turbo boosters.
Narration,Narrative,Do you people still use fossil
Narration,Narrative,"fuels, or have you discovered"
Narration,Narrative,crystalic fusion?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, let's see, we've got double"
Narration,Narrative,A's --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Watch yourself!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist
Narration,Narrative,laser.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Halt!  Who goes there?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Woody)
Narration,Narrative,Do you know these life forms?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Alright, everyone.  You're clear to"
Narration,Narrative,come up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walks over to the toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Why, thank you..."
Narration,Narrative,(pulls away)
Narration,Narrative,Now thank you all for your kind
Narration,Narrative,welcome.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Say!  What's that button do?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'll show you.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz presses a button on his chest.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all GASP IN AWE.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Woody's got something like"
Narration,Narrative,"that.  His is a pullstring, only"
Narration,Narrative,it --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh yeah, but not like this one."
Narration,Narrative,This is a quality sound system.
Narration,Narrative,"Probably all copper wiring, huh?"
Narration,Narrative,"So, uh, where are you from?"
Narration,Narrative,Singapore?  Hong Kong?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well...no, actually I'm stationed"
Narration,Narrative,up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector
Narration,Narrative,4.  As a member of the elite
Narration,Narrative,Universe Protection Unit of the
Narration,Narrative,"Space Ranger Corps, I protect the"
Narration,Narrative,galaxy from the threat of invasion
Narration,Narrative,"from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn"
Narration,Narrative,enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz"
Narration,Narrative,arrived.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word-"
Narration,Narrative,for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not"
Narration,Narrative,"actually  from Mattel, I'm actually"
Narration,Narrative,from a smaller company that was
Narration,Narrative,purchased in a leveraged buy-out.
Narration,Narrative,"Well, I don't really understand the"
Narration,Narrative,"financials, but..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody walks over to Bo Peep.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You'd think they've never seen a
Narration,Narrative,new toy before.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well sure, look at him.  He's got"
Narration,Narrative,more gadgets on him then a Swiss
Narration,Narrative,army knife.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his"
Narration,Narrative,laser light.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You"
Narration,Narrative,don't want to be in the way when my
Narration,Narrative,laser goes off.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, a laser!  How come you don't"
Narration,Narrative,"have a laser, Woody?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's not a laser!  It's a little
Narration,Narrative,lightbulb that blinks!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What's with him?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Laser-envy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All right, that's enough.  Look,"
Narration,Narrative,we're all very impressed with
Narration,Narrative,Andy's new toy --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Toy?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,T-O-Y.  Toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Excuse me, I think the word you're"
Narration,Narrative,searching for is Space Ranger.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The word I'm searching for I can't
Narration,Narrative,say because there's pre-school toys
Narration,Narrative,present.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm"
Narration,Narrative,curious.  What does a Space Ranger
Narration,Narrative,actually do?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's not a Space Ranger!  He
Narration,Narrative,doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers
Narration,Narrative,or fly --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Excuse me.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Again the toys GASP IN AWE.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, what?!...What?!  These are"
Narration,Narrative,plastic.  He can't fly!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They are a terillium-carbonic alloy
Narration,Narrative,and I CAN fly.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, you can't."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yes, I can."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You can't!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I tell you, I could fly around this"
Narration,Narrative,room with my eyes closed!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All right, then, I will."
Narration,Narrative,(to toys)
Narration,Narrative,Stand back everyone!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the
Narration,Narrative,edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost.  He poses like a
Narration,Narrative,"high diver, shuts his eyes..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,To infinity and beyond!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...and leaps off the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and"
Narration,Narrative,bounces right back up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the"
Narration,Narrative,"track, through the loop, and off a ramp.  Buzz soars upward"
Narration,Narrative,into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels.  The impact
Narration,Narrative,turns on the PLANE'S MOTOR making it (and Buzz) spin around
Narration,Narrative,and around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from
Narration,Narrative,"the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and
Narration,Narrative,then opens his eyes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The crowd of toys rush Buzz, CHEERING AND CLAPPING WITH"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew"
Narration,Narrative,magnificently!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I found my moving buddy!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Why, thank you.  Thank you all."
Narration,Narrative,Thank you.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,That wasn't flying!  That was
Narration,Narrative,falling with style!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Man, the dolls must really go for"
Narration,Narrative,you!
Narration,Narrative,(aside)
Narration,Narrative,Can you teach me that?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming."
Narration,Narrative,"Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,"
Narration,Narrative,everything will be just the way it
Narration,Narrative,was.  They'll see... they'll see.
Narration,Narrative,I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,SONG: STRANGE THINGS plays over montage.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed,"
Narration,Narrative,running around the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"B) Andy sets Woody down on the floor.  Next he ""lands"" Buzz"
Narration,Narrative,Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody.  Andy shoots Buzz's
Narration,Narrative,laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if
Narration,Narrative,he'd been blown away by the laser.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and
Narration,Narrative,cowboy pajamas.
Narration,Narrative,
MATCH CUT TO,Dialogue,
MATCH CUT TO,Dialogue,Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas
MATCH CUT TO,Dialogue,and a homemade spaceman's helmet.
MATCH CUT TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,D) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom
Narration,Narrative,"transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the"
Narration,Narrative,"wall, the pillow, the bedspread."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,E) Buzz watches Rex execute a WIMPY ROAR.  The space ranger
Narration,Narrative,"suggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this"
Narration,Narrative,"time giving a ""JURASSIC PARK"" ROAR."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"F) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of"
Narration,Narrative,Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's
Narration,Narrative,"hair, chatting away like a hair dresser."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"G) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys"
Narration,Narrative,"as weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,"
Narration,Narrative,using his feet as a treadmill.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends
Narration,Narrative,"up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the"
Narration,Narrative,barbell.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"H) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the"
Narration,Narrative,checkerboard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and
Narration,Narrative,"Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's ""ship"" up on"
Narration,Narrative,top of ABC blocks for repair.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the"
Narration,Narrative,pieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the
Narration,Narrative,dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is"
Narration,Narrative,stretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's
Narration,Narrative,wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his"
Narration,Narrative,front end no choice but to eventually follow.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"J) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until"
Narration,Narrative,just Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which
Narration,Narrative,toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next"
Narration,Narrative,to him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks
Narration,Narrative,"back into the box, closing the lid to..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The black screen splits horizontally to become...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All is clear -- no sign of Andy.  Woody throws open the lid
Narration,Narrative,of the toy box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Finally!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He takes a couple DEEP BREATHS of fresh air, then discovers"
Narration,Narrative,that his hat is missing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(looking back into
Narration,Narrative,the toy box)
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  Who's got my hat?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(sarcastic)
Narration,Narrative,Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!
Narration,Narrative,(grabs the hat)
Narration,Narrative,Give me that!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody leaps out of the toy box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog."
Narration,Narrative,Let me show you something.  It
Narration,Narrative,looks as though I've been accepted
Narration,Narrative,into your culture.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his"
Narration,Narrative,name on me.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the
Narration,Narrative,sole of his boot.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The name ""ANDY"" is written on it in permanent marker."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wow!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With permanent ink, too!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, I must get back to repairing"
Narration,Narrative,my ship.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walks away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody looks at HIS foot -- ""Andy"" is written on it also but"
Narration,Narrative,"in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Don't let it get to you, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly"
Narration,Narrative,straightens up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(nonchalant)
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what"
Narration,Narrative,do you mean?  Who?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I know Andy's excited about Buzz,"
Narration,Narrative,"but you know, he'll always have a"
Narration,Narrative,special place for you.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(walking past)
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Alright!  That's it!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody angrily marches across the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the"
Narration,Narrative,ABC blocks.  Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under
Narration,Narrative,the ship like a mechanic.  Snake and Robot stand by waiting
Narration,Narrative,for instructions.  Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Unidirectional bonding strip.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape
Narration,Narrative,dispenser.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot"
Narration,Narrative,and rolls him out from under the ship.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away"
Narration,Narrative,"from Andy.  He's mine, and no one"
Narration,Narrative,is taking him away from me.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What are you talking about?
Narration,Narrative,(to Robot)
Narration,Narrative,Where's that bonding strip?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz rolls himself back under.  Woody rolls him out again.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,And another thing.  Stop with this
Narration,Narrative,spaceman thing.  It's getting on my
Narration,Narrative,nerves.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Are you saying you want to lodge a
Narration,Narrative,complaint with Star Command?
Narration,Narrative,"Oh okay, so you want to do it the"
Narration,Narrative,"hard way, huh?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Don't even think about it, cowboy!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah, tough guy?!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a"
Narration,Narrative,button that makes the spaceman's helmet open.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz grabs his neck, GASPING FOR AIR.  He drops to his knees"
Narration,Narrative,"and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is unsure how to react.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Suddenly, Buzz SNIFFS the air."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The air isn't toxic.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,How dare you open a spaceman's
Narration,Narrative,helmet on an uncharted planet!  My
Narration,Narrative,eyeballs could've been sucked from
Narration,Narrative,their sockets!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz closes his helmet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz"
Narration,Narrative,"Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I"
Narration,Narrative,thought it was an act!
Narration,Narrative,(to the room)
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL"
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"You're mocking me, aren't you?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no, no, no..."
Narration,Narrative,(pointing behind Buzz)
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz, look!  An alien!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Where?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz falls for the trick and turns around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody stops short.  All the toys look to the bedroom window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Uh-oh.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky hides under the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's Sid!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I thought he was at summer camp!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They must have kicked him out early
Narration,Narrative,this year.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys rush over to the window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!  Not Sid!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...Incoming!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"From out the window, SID PHILLIPS, a hyperactive ten-year-"
Narration,Narrative,"old, and his dog, SCUD, can be roughly made out jumping"
Narration,Narrative,around in their backyard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard.
Narration,Narrative,Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his
Narration,Narrative,"leash, barking wildly."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Who is it this time?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Right here, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody turns to see, LENNY, a pair of wind-up binoculars,"
Narration,Narrative,approaching him from the other end of the desk.  Woody picks
Narration,Narrative,Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one"
Narration,Narrative,of these again!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the
Narration,Narrative,center of the backyard.  A huge M-80 is strapped to the
Narration,Narrative,doll's back with masking tape.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(plays under the next
Narration,Narrative,5 lines)
Narration,Narrative,"Just stay where you are, Corporal!"
Narration,Narrative,"Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up."
Narration,Narrative,I know you're tired!  I know your
Narration,Narrative,"leg is cramping, but you can't move."
Narration,Narrative,Do you hear me?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz breaks through the crowd.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What's going on?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nothing that concerns you spacemen.
Narration,Narrative,Just us TOYS.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'd better take a look anyway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Why is that soldier strapped to an
Narration,Narrative,explosive device?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(redirecting Buzz's view)
Narration,Narrative,That's why.  Sid.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sure is a hairy fellah.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He is sporting a skull t-shirt and LAUGHING HIDEOUSLY.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,THAT is Sid!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You mean that happy child?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,That ain't no happy child.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, then we've got to do something!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz steps up onto the window ledge.  The toys GASP IN SHOCK.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What are you doing?!!  Get down
Narration,Narrative,from there!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'm going to go teach that boy a
Narration,Narrative,lesson.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt"
Narration,Narrative,him with your scary laser.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody presses Buzz's laser button.  It emits a WIMPY
Narration,Narrative,ELECTRONIC BEEP.  Buzz quickly pulls his arm away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Be careful with that, it's"
Narration,Narrative,extremely dangerous.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting"
Narration,Narrative,the fuse of the M80.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hit the dirt!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys jump away from the window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of
Narration,Narrative,Andy's house.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's toys peek over the window sill.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat
Narration,Narrative,Carl once stood.  Sid jumps up and down victoriously while
Narration,Narrative,Scud resumes his BARKING.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I could have stopped him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz, I would love to see you try."
Narration,Narrative,(gesturing to Sid's yard)
Narration,Narrative,'Course I'd love to see you as a
Narration,Narrative,crater.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The sooner we move the better.
Narration,Narrative,
DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A ""FOR SALE"" real estate sign stands in the front yard."
Narration,Narrative,"Another sign reading ""SOLD"" hangs from the bottom."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in.  The room is
Narration,Narrative,"full of packing boxes, most of them half full.  Andy is"
Narration,Narrative,playing with Woody and Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,To infinity and beyond!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, all this packing makes me"
Narration,Narrative,hungry.  What would you say to
Narration,Narrative,"dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right
Narration,Narrative,on top of Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Go wash your hands and I'll get
Narration,Narrative,Molly ready.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves
Narration,Narrative,Buzz off of him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can I bring some toys?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You can bring ONE toy...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just one?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody perks up with concern.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,One toy?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away"
Narration,Narrative,towards the opposite end of the desk.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk.
Narration,Narrative,"With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering)
Narration,Narrative,Will Andy pick me?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He tips the 8 ball over.  The triangular oracle floats up to
Narration,Narrative,the surface.  Its prediction reads: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust.  It rolls across
Narration,Narrative,the desk and falls behind it with a LOUD THUD.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk
Narration,Narrative,and peers down it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom.  The space is
Narration,Narrative,"a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit...a toy."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks across the desk at Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He is HUMMING TO HIMSELF as he forages through Andy's
Narration,Narrative,"pen/pencil tray looking for ""tools"" to repair his ship with."
Narration,Narrative,Right behind Buzz sits
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the"
Narration,Narrative,"8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!"
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!"
Narration,Narrative,We've got trouble!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Trouble?!
Narration,Narrative,(looking around)
Narration,Narrative,Where?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pointing to the back
Narration,Narrative,of the desk)
Narration,Narrative,Down there.  Just down there.  A
Narration,Narrative,"helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,"
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Then we've no time to lose!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I don't see anything!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody picks up the remote for the RC Car and switches it on.
Narration,Narrative,RC's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep"
Narration,Narrative,looking.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody hits the ""FORWARD"" button on the remote and steers the"
Narration,Narrative,RC Car straight for Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What kind of a toy -- ?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz turns to see RC headed straight for him.  He dives out
Narration,Narrative,of the way as the RC Car SMASHES into the base of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board.  Buzz
Narration,Narrative,"ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk"
Narration,Narrative,like arrows.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He looks up at the desk and GASPS as the bulletin board
Narration,Narrative,slams down onto...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,knocking it out of its stand.  The globe starts rolling
Narration,Narrative,right at Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind"
Narration,Narrative,"him, Indiana Jones style.  Buzz gets stuck ""log rolling"" on"
Narration,Narrative,"a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the"
Narration,Narrative,way onto the window ledge.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style
Narration,Narrative,"desklamp.  The arm of the lamp swings all the way around,"
Narration,Narrative,barely missing Woody...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...and knocks Buzz out the window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks out the window.  No sign of Buzz.  All the other
Narration,Narrative,toys rush over to the sill.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I don't see him in the driveway!  I
Narration,Narrative,think he bounced into Sid's yard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody backs away from the COMMOTION, unnoticed."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(electric motor sounds)
Narration,Narrative,Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex looks over at RC.  The remote control car is bouncing up
Narration,Narrative,and down excitedly.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say
Narration,Narrative,something!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys turn from the window to RC.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(leaning down close
Narration,Narrative,to RC)
Narration,Narrative,"What is it, boy?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(electric motor sounds)
Narration,Narrative,Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's sayin' that this was no accident.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Huh?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What do you mean?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...
Narration,Narrative,(pointing at Woody)
Narration,Narrative,...by Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait a minute.  You -- you don't
Narration,Narrative,think I meant to knock Buzz out the
Narration,Narrative,"window, do you Potato Head?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you"
Narration,Narrative,back-stabbin' murderer!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Now, it was an accident!  Guys,"
Narration,Narrative,"c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(backing away)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, I don't like confrontations."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You"
Narration,Narrative,are an absolute disgrace!  You
Narration,Narrative,don't deserve to --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody seals the lid back on the bucket.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head starts closing in on Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on
Narration,Narrative,"your playtime, could ya Woody?"
Narration,Narrative,Didn't want to face the fact that
Narration,Narrative,Buzz just might be Andy's new
Narration,Narrative,"favorite toy, so you got rid of him."
Narration,Narrative,"Well, what if Andy starts playin'"
Narration,Narrative,"with me more, Woody, huh?  You"
Narration,Narrative,"gonna knock me outta the window, too?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the
Narration,Narrative,desk -- trapped.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I don't think we should give him
Narration,Narrative,the chance.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"There he is, men!  Frag him!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The army men yell CHARGE and pounce on Woody, while all the"
Narration,Narrative,rest of the toys close in.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Let's string him up by his pull-
Narration,Narrative,string!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I got dibs on his hat!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Would you boys stop it?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Tackle him!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can"
Narration,Narrative,explain everything --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Andy, c'mon!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got"
Narration,Narrative,to get Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Retreat!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where
Narration,Narrative,Woody is lying.  Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching
Narration,Narrative,around the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, I haven't seen him."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Psssst!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks across the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head and Etch-A-Sketch peek out of a packing box.
Narration,Narrative,Etch-A-Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head
Narration,Narrative,points an accusing finger in Woody's direction.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody GULPS.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"But Mom, I can't find him!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, honey, just grab some other"
Narration,Narrative,toy!  Now c'mon!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Okay...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He grabs Woody and walks out of the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the
Narration,Narrative,family van in the driveway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I
Narration,Narrative,left him right there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Honey, I'm sure he's around."
Narration,Narrative,You'll find him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"next to the van begins to rustle.  Hands part the foliage,"
Narration,Narrative,revealing Buzz.  He eyes Woody going into the van and does a
Narration,Narrative,slow burn.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The van ENGINE STARTS UP.  Buzz races out of the bush, and"
Narration,Narrative,"with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it"
Narration,Narrative,pulls out of the driveway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable"
Narration,Narrative,distance above the ground.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window,"
Narration,Narrative,"supervising the lowering of the ""monkey chain."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(holding up an empty barrel)
Narration,Narrative,There aren't any more!  That's the
Narration,Narrative,whole barrel.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(yelling out window)
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!
Narration,Narrative,We're formulating another plan!
Narration,Narrative,Stay calm!
Narration,Narrative,(beat)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, where could he be?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Can I help pump the gas?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Both Mrs. Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly
Narration,Narrative,sleeps up front in her car seat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yeah?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(sarcastic)
Narration,Narrative,"Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life.  He"
Narration,Narrative,"stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince"
Narration,Narrative,those guys it was an accident?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody.  He is furious.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll"
Narration,Narrative,"find you here, he'll take us back"
Narration,Narrative,"to the room, and then you can tell"
Narration,Narrative,everyone that this was all just a
Narration,Narrative,big mistake.  Huh?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No response from Buzz.  Just an angry stare.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(weakly)
Narration,Narrative,Right?  Buddy?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I just want you to know that even
Narration,Narrative,"though you tried to terminate me,"
Narration,Narrative,revenge is not an idea we promote
Narration,Narrative,on my planet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh.  Oh, that's good."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(getting in Woody's face)
Narration,Narrative,"But we're not on my planet, are we?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz lunges for Woody.  The two toys fly off the seat and
Narration,Narrative,out the open side door of the van.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked"
Narration,Narrative,in mortal combat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of
Narration,Narrative,me?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody lunges with all his might.  He smacks Buzz in the
Narration,Narrative,"face, making it SQUEAK with every blow."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Owwwww!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating"
Narration,Narrative,BUZZ'S SAMPLED VOICE buttons.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys stop fighting.  Before they can react...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Next stop...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The van drives off.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
Narration,Narrative,"drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Doesn't he realize that I'm not
Narration,Narrative,there?
Narration,Narrative,(beat)
Narration,Narrative,"I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings.  He flips open his"
Narration,Narrative,wrist communicator.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The
Narration,Narrative,local Sheriff and I seem to be at a
Narration,Narrative,huge refueling station of some
Narration,Narrative,sort --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to"
Narration,Narrative,seething anger.  He charges at Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
Narration,Narrative,behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where
Narration,Narrative,he stands on the pavement.  The truck ROARS over him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,stops just millimeters from Woody's nose.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back"
Narration,Narrative,under the truck until he bumps into Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into wrist communicator)
Narration,Narrative,"According to my nava-computer, the --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering)
Narration,Narrative,"Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sheriff, this is no time to panic."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,This is the perfect time to panic!
Narration,Narrative,"I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're"
Narration,Narrative,going to move from their house in
Narration,Narrative,two days and it's all your fault!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me
Narration,Narrative,out of the window in the first
Narration,Narrative,place --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't"
Narration,Narrative,shown up in your stupid little
Narration,Narrative,cardboard spaceship and taken away
Narration,Narrative,everything that was important to
Narration,Narrative,me --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Don't talk to me about importance.
Narration,Narrative,Because of YOU the security of this
Narration,Narrative,entire universe is in jeopardy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(incredulous)
Narration,Narrative,WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
Narration,Narrative,stars.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Right now, poised at the edge of"
Narration,Narrative,"the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been"
Narration,Narrative,secretly building a weapon with the
Narration,Narrative,destructive capacity to annihilate
Narration,Narrative,an entire planet.  I alone have
Narration,Narrative,information that reveals this
Narration,Narrative,weapon's only weakness.
Narration,Narrative,(pointing at Woody)
Narration,Narrative,"And you, my friend, are responsible"
Narration,Narrative,for delaying my rendez-vous with
Narration,Narrative,Star Command.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody explodes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the
Narration,Narrative,"real Buzz Lightyear, you're an"
Narration,Narrative,action figure!!  You are a child's
Narration,Narrative,plaything!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Beat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You are a sad strange little man
Narration,Narrative,and you have my pity.  Farewell.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walks off.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya"
Narration,Narrative,looney!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody walks away in the opposite direction.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,Rendez-vous with Star Command.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Gas Dude!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You talkin' to me?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you"
Narration,Narrative,know where Cutting Blvd. is?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just a moment...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks in the direction of the bell.  His face lights
Narration,Narrative,up at the sight of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,Pizza Planet...Andy!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody takes a step forward and then stops.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!  I can't show my face in"
Narration,Narrative,that room without Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody runs back under the tanker truck.  Buzz is at the far
Narration,Narrative,"end of the truck, walking away from Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz!  Buzz, come back!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continuing to walk away)
Narration,Narrative,Go away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
Narration,Narrative,then eyes...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, Buzz, you've gotta come back."
Narration,Narrative,I found a spaceship!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the"
Narration,Narrative,pizza's are getting cold here.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
Narration,Narrative,safety of a nearby oilcan display.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Now you're sure this spacefreighter
Narration,Narrative,will return to its port of origin
Narration,Narrative,once it jettisons its food supply?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Uh-huh.  And when we get there,"
Narration,Narrative,we'll be able to find a way to
Narration,Narrative,transport you...home.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, then let's climb abroad."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
Narration,Narrative,pizza truck.  Woody chases after him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's"
Narration,Narrative,get in the back.  No one will see
Narration,Narrative,us there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Negative.  There are no restraining
Narration,Narrative,harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll
Narration,Narrative,be much safer in the cockpit.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear"
Narration,Narrative,"view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a"
Narration,Narrative,"right, huh?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yeah.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, thanks for the directions."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the"
Narration,Narrative,bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody lets out a YELL, as the back hatch slams back down on"
Narration,Narrative,"his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is hidden from THE PIZZA DRIVER's view by a stack of
Narration,Narrative,pizzas in their insulated covers.  Buzz prudently fastens
Narration,Narrative,his safety belt.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It'll be safer in the cockpit than
Narration,Narrative,the cargo bay.  What an idiot!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling"
Narration,Narrative,Woody to the back of the truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns"
Narration,Narrative,and hills at high speeds.  Woody is helplessly thrown around
Narration,Narrative,"the truck.  With every blow, Woody YELPS in pain."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The truck climbs a steep hill.  Woody looks up just in time
Narration,Narrative,to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,barreling towards him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
CUT TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We MOVE DOWN to reveal...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the"
Narration,Narrative,passenger window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  As
Narration,Narrative,"CUSTOMERS approach the front, the guards part their crossed"
Narration,Narrative,"""pizza spears,"" allowing the patrons to enter."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
Narration,Narrative,Pizza Planet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,VARIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS blare out from speakers:
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for
Narration,Narrative,T-minus 30 minutes and counting...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The white zone is for eating pizza
Narration,Narrative,only.  The white zone is for...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and"
Narration,Narrative,truck bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sheriff!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is gone.  Just the toolbox and strewn trash.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Sheriff?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody.  He peels off
Narration,Narrative,the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,There you are.  Now the entrance is
Narration,Narrative,heavily guarded.  We need a way to
Narration,Narrative,get inside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody rises from the trash with a ""MEGA-GULP"" cup on his head."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Great idea, Woody!  I like your"
Narration,Narrative,thinking!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,In the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
Narration,Narrative,"littered around it.  MORE CUSTOMERS approach the ""guarded"""
Narration,Narrative,entrance.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You are clear to enter.  Welcome to
Narration,Narrative,Pizza Planet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
Narration,Narrative,through.  Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
Narration,Narrative,"and ""MEGA-GULP"" cup stand up."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(in burger container)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(in container)
Narration,Narrative,"Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is"
Narration,Narrative,closing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze
Narration,Narrative,"immediately as a GROUP OF KIDS run past, forcing the toys to"
Narration,Narrative,pose as discarded trash.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking."
Narration,Narrative,Buzz bumps into Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(using straw as periscope)
Narration,Narrative,Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(mouthing with burger box)
Narration,Narrative,Sorry.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
Narration,Narrative,off their disguises.  They then take a good look at...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
Narration,Narrative,playing video games.  A sea of HI-TECH SOUNDS and lights
Narration,Narrative,overwhelm the place.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is beaming with hope.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What a space port.  Good work, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but"
Narration,Narrative,none of the kids look familiar to him.  Just then he HEARS...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Mom, can I play Black Hole?"
Narration,Narrative,"Please, please, please?!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns around and through the video games he spots...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,Andy!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What's Black Hole?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, it's so cool..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The family begins to walk away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Now we need to find a ship that's
Narration,Narrative,headed for Sector 12 --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
Narration,Narrative,Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!
Narration,Narrative,There's a special ship.  I just saw
Narration,Narrative,it!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You mean it has hyperdrive?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hyper-active hyperdrive, and"
Narration,Narrative,"astro...uh, turf."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys manage to get ahead of Andy.  Woody peeks around
Narration,Narrative,the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and
Narration,Narrative,Andy to approach.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(tracking Andy and family)
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, c'mon, that's it..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Where is it?  I don't see the --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz stops short at the sight of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Spaceship.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Alright Buzz, get ready..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice,"
Narration,Narrative,his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, Buzz, when I say ""go,"" we're"
Narration,Narrative,gonna jump in the basket --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone.  He looks across the
Narration,Narrative,way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game
Narration,Narrative,"through the ""PRIZE"" slot."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It has already gone past.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Dooh!  No!  This cannot be
Narration,Narrative,happening to me!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold"
Narration,Narrative,back for a moment as some SCREAMING children pass by.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot
Narration,Narrative,from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(excited)
Narration,Narrative,A stranger!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,From the outside!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Oo-o-o-o-o-o...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I
Narration,Narrative,come in peace!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Tell us!  What is it like outside?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The squeeze toys rush Buzz like JABBERING excited children.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane"
Narration,Narrative,game and dives through the prize slot.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,This is an intergalactic emergency!
Narration,Narrative,I need to commandeer your vessel to
Narration,Narrative,Sector 12!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by
Narration,Narrative,the cute alien toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued; to the aliens)
Narration,Narrative,Who's in charge here?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the aliens point upward.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz look up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It dangles directly above the toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The claw is our master.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The claw chooses who will go and
Narration,Narrative,who will stay.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,This is ludicrous.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(laughter)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody GASPS at the recognition of Sid's voice.  He turns to
Narration,Narrative,see Sid heading straight for the crane game.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!  Sid!!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the"
Narration,Narrative,two of them deep into the pile of aliens.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Get down!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
Narration,Narrative,pants pocket.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,"What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I"
Narration,Narrative,was --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,YOU are the one that decided to
Narration,Narrative,climb into this --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,Sh-h-h-h-h-h.  The claw.  It moves.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It moves into position and hovers directly above the area
Narration,Narrative,where Woody and Buzz are hiding.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
Narration,Narrative,right on top of Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering excitedly)
Narration,Narrative,I have been chosen!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by"
Narration,Narrative,the claw.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Farewell, my friends!  I go on to a"
Narration,Narrative,better place.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Gotcha!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,"
Narration,Narrative,forcing the space ranger to freeze.  Sid suddenly spots Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A Buzz Lightyear!  No way!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way"
Narration,Narrative,"to escape.  Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
Narration,Narrative,"He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few"
Narration,Narrative,"attempts, is able to pry the door open."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and"
Narration,Narrative,grabs his head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The claw begins to lift Buzz up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz, NO!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of"
Narration,Narrative,"aliens, out of Sid's view."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(slamming his fist
Narration,Narrative,against the glass)
Narration,Narrative,Wha -- ?  Hey!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the"
Narration,Narrative,"door with Buzz.  Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the"
Narration,Narrative,pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He has been chosen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  What are you doing?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He must go.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you"
Narration,Narrative,zealots!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He must go!  Do not fight the claw!
Narration,Narrative,Do not anger the claw!  He has been
Narration,Narrative,chosen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
Narration,Narrative,"air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Alright!  Double prizes!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
Narration,Narrative,snatched up by Sid.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(looking at his two
Narration,Narrative,new toys)
Narration,Narrative,Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard.  He
Narration,Narrative,is HUMMING to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
Narration,Narrative,backpack in his hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
Narration,Narrative,towards the front door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to"
Narration,Narrative,see Sid's house.  He recognizes Andy's house next door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the"
Narration,Narrative,backpack.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling
Narration,Narrative,from here!  You're almost home.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nirvana is coming!  The mystic
Narration,Narrative,portal awaits!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Alien)
Narration,Narrative,Will you be quiet?!!
Narration,Narrative,(to both)
Narration,Narrative,"You guys don't get it, do you?"
Narration,Narrative,"Once we go into Sid's house, we"
Narration,Narrative,won't be coming out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The front door opens to reveal Scud.  The dog lunges
Narration,Narrative,"straight for the backpack, BARKING."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good"
Narration,Narrative,boy!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The dog begrudgingly obeys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid's hand reaches into the backpack.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys go still.  Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
Narration,Narrative,backpack.  The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's
Narration,Narrative,snout.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ready, set, NOW."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in"
Narration,Narrative,"his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and Woody react in horror.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah!  Hey, Hannah!!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody and Buzz glance up to see HANNAH, Sid's frail little"
Narration,Narrative,"sister, carrying her Janie Doll."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Did I get my package in the mail?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I dunno.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Whaddaya mean, you don't know?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(insistent)
Narration,Narrative,I don't know!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(mock concern)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh no, Hannah!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Look!  Janie!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He grabs the doll.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,She's sick!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(panic rising)
Narration,Narrative,No she's NOT --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'll have to perform one of
Narration,Narrative,my...operations!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Not Sid's room...not there...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid races to his bedroom door.  Hannah is right behind.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid!  Give her back!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid just LAUGHS.  He charges into the room and slams the
Narration,Narrative,door in his sister's face.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pounding on his door)
Narration,Narrative,Sid!  Sid!...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over
Narration,Narrative,to a makeshift workbench.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Doctor)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no.  We have a sick patient"
Narration,Narrative,"here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid CLICKS on a bare bulb dangling above his ""operating"
Narration,Narrative,"table."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as
Narration,Narrative,Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid, give her back!  Give her back"
Narration,Narrative,now!  I'm telling!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Doctor)
Narration,Narrative,Patient is...
Narration,Narrative,(straining while
Narration,Narrative,tightening vise)
Narration,Narrative,...pre-e-epped.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it
Narration,Narrative,like a surgeon's mask.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Doctor)
Narration,Narrative,No one's ever attempted a double
Narration,Narrative,bypass brain transplant before.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Doctor)
Narration,Narrative,Now for the tricky part -- pliers!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering to Woody)
Narration,Narrative,I don't believe that man's ever
Narration,Narrative,been to medical school.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid struggles for a moment with his ""patient"" then stops."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Nurse)
Narration,Narrative,"Doctor, you've done it!"
Narration,Narrative,(running to the door)
Narration,Narrative,Hannah?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He opens the door.  Hannah is standing there, looking worried."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Janie's all better now.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a
Narration,Narrative,pterodactyl's.  Hannah SCREAMS at the sight of the
Narration,Narrative,monstrosity and bolts down the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,She's lying!  Whatever she says
Narration,Narrative,it's not true!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah,"
Narration,Narrative,slamming the door behind him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new
Narration,Narrative,"surroundings.  Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains"
Narration,Narrative,and power tools adorn the messy room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They are in Hell...toy Hell.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We are gonna die.
Narration,Narrative,(bolting out of the pack)
Narration,Narrative,I'm outta here!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to
Narration,Narrative,open it.  No good.  Woody drops to the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Locked!  There's gotta be another
Narration,Narrative,way out of here.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is startled by the noise.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its
Narration,Narrative,side.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes"
Narration,Narrative,it like a weapon.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just then a shadow passes by Woody.  He turns quickly but
Narration,Narrative,sees nothing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He hears a NOISE from under Sid's bed.  Woody turns on the
Narration,Narrative,flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the
Narration,Narrative,"noise, illuminating..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!"
Narration,Narrative,Come out here.  Do you know a way
Narration,Narrative,out of here?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one-"
Narration,Narrative,eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set
Narration,Narrative,pieces.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody.
Narration,Narrative,"Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Various other MUTANT TOYS begin to emerge from the shadows:
Narration,Narrative,"a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with"
Narration,Narrative,"a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack-"
Narration,Narrative,"in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others)."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,B-B-B-Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as
Narration,Narrative,"they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them"
Narration,Narrative,off into the shadows.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They're cannibals!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody retreats back into the backpack.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters.  He punches a
Narration,Narrative,button on his chest.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"May day!  May day!  Come in, Star"
Narration,Narrative,Command!  Send reinforcements!...
Narration,Narrative,(pause)
Narration,Narrative,"Star Command, do you copy?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No response.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz adjusts his laser light.  It emits a short BLIP.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(aiming his arm out
Narration,Narrative,the pack)
Narration,Narrative,I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if"
Narration,Narrative,anyone attacks us we can blink 'em
Narration,Narrative,to death.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while
Narration,Narrative,"Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Some bushes rustle below.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, you guys!  I think I've found"
Narration,Narrative,him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  The
Narration,Narrative,annoyed MEOW of a cat is heard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Whiskers!  Will you get out of
Narration,Narrative,here?!  You're interfering with the
Narration,Narrative,search and rescue.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rex turns off the flashlight.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whispering)
Narration,Narrative,Look!  They're home!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys duck behind the sill.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  Andy and Mrs.
Narration,Narrative,Davis get out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Mom, have you seen Woody?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Where was the last place you left him?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(searching the van)
Narration,Narrative,Right here in the van.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're"
Narration,Narrative,just not looking hard enough.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all look at one another.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's gone?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran"
Narration,Narrative,away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window."
Narration,Narrative,Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was
Narration,Narrative,guilty.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Who would've thought he was capable
Narration,Narrative,of such atrocities?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly"
Narration,Narrative,crestfallen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
Narration,Narrative,
DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Interrogator)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel"
Narration,Narrative,base?  Talk!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on"
Narration,Narrative,the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid crosses to the window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Interrogator)
Narration,Narrative,I can see your will is strong.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid opens the window shade.  Bright sunlight shines down
Narration,Narrative,onto Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
Narration,Narrative,focuses the beam on Woody's forehead.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Interrogator)
Narration,Narrative,Where are your rebel friends now?
Narration,Narrative,"Heh, heh."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins
Narration,Narrative,to smolder.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid pulls the magnifying glass away.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Alright!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid runs out of the room.  As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps"
Narration,Narrative,"up SCREAMING, his forehead burning."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
Narration,Narrative,"floor, and dunks his head in."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup"
Narration,Narrative,darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl.
Narration,Narrative,Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like
Narration,Narrative,glasses.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Are you alright?
Narration,Narrative,(whacking him on the back)
Narration,Narrative,"I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A"
Narration,Narrative,lesser man would have talked under
Narration,Narrative,such torture.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
Narration,Narrative,spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(checking his wrist communicator)
Narration,Narrative,Still no word from Star Command.
Narration,Narrative,We're not that far from the
Narration,Narrative,spaceport --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's eyes light up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  It's open.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The door!  It's open!  We're free!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody runs for the door.  Buzz follows.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  Woody
Narration,Narrative,hides behind Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do"
Narration,Narrative,something!  Quick!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Shield your eyes!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz fires his laser at them.  The little red beam just
Narration,Narrative,flickers against Babyface's head.  The mutant toys look
Narration,Narrative,confusedly at each other.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's not working.  I recharged it
Narration,Narrative,before I left.  It should be good
Narration,Narrative,for hours --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use"
Narration,Narrative,your karate chop action!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant"
Narration,Narrative,"toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's"
Narration,Narrative,"arm involuntarily ""chop"" up and down."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to mutants)
Narration,Narrative,Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?
Narration,Narrative,Stop that!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,"
Narration,Narrative,continually chopping Buzz's arm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody, stop it!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody races down the corridor...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to himself)
Narration,Narrative,There's no place like home.
Narration,Narrative,There's no place like home.
Narration,Narrative,There's no place like home...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,"
Narration,Narrative,and is confronted by...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,asleep on the landing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  He
Narration,Narrative,slowly backs up the stairs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the
Narration,Narrative,hallway wall.  He covers Woody's mouth with his hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(muffled gasp)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(whisper)
Narration,Narrative,"Another stunt like that, cowboy --"
Narration,Narrative,you're going to get us killed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pulling Buzz's hand away)
Narration,Narrative,Don't tell me what to do!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Shhh!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts
Narration,Narrative,across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,"Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
Narration,Narrative,meets up with Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,As he stands...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that"
Narration,Narrative,Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
Narration,Narrative,until --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It SNAPS off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's
Narration,Narrative,voice box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It opens.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Giddy-up partner!...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"GROWLING, Scud starts up the stairs."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,...We got to get this wagon train a
Narration,Narrative,movin'!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz take off running.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Split up!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  Buzz
Narration,Narrative,dives behind one while Woody jumps into...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of
Narration,Narrative,the landing.  CRASHED can be heard from behind the closet
Narration,Narrative,"door, getting Scud's attention."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud SNIFFING AND
Narration,Narrative,GROWLING at the closet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to"
Narration,Narrative,enter Buzz's doorway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The noise stops the dog in his tracks.  Both Scud and Buzz
Narration,Narrative,look up to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,MR. PHILLIPS is asleep on a La-Z-Boy recliner in front of
Narration,Narrative,the T.V.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud backs out and heads down the stairs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Calling Buzz Lightyear!!  Come in
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear!!  This is Star
Narration,Narrative,Command.  Buzz Lightyear!  Do you
Narration,Narrative,read me?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Star Command!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
Narration,Narrative,speak into it when he is interrupted.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read
Narration,Narrative,you loud and clear!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz turns around to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
Narration,Narrative,stars.  The image quickly changes to two young boys playing
Narration,Narrative,in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs"
Narration,Narrative,your help!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into toy wrist communicator)
Narration,Narrative,On the way!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  He walks
Narration,Narrative,slowly towards the television set.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The world's greatest superhero!
Narration,Narrative,Now the world's greatest TOY!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being
Narration,Narrative,displayed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz has it all!  Locking wrist
Narration,Narrative,communicator!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Karate chop action!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wow!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With every feature demonstrated on the TV, Buzz compares the"
Narration,Narrative,same feature on himself.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Pulsating laserlight!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Total annihilation!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Multi-phrase voice simulator!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's a secret mission in uncharted
Narration,Narrative,space!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz presses the same button on his uniform.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's a secret mission in uncharted
Narration,Narrative,space!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,And best of all...
Narration,Narrative,"(big ""monster truck"" voice)"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,To Infinity and Beyond!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"On the TV screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears"
Narration,Narrative,to be launched through the air.  The words:  NOT A FLYING
Narration,Narrative,TOY flash across the bottom of the screen.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(non-excited lawyer voice)
Narration,Narrative,Not a flying toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Get your Buzz Lightyear action
Narration,Narrative,figure and save a galaxy near you!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
Narration,Narrative,Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Available at all Al's Toy Barn
Narration,Narrative,outlets in the tri-county area.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is stricken.  He looks down at his wrist communicator
Narration,Narrative,and opens it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: ""MADE"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
Narration,Narrative,through the railing at...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  A bird flies past."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You are a toy!  You can't fly!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz bows his head, defeated."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  He"
Narration,Narrative,"slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny"
Narration,Narrative,"its message of ""Made in Taiwan."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  He pops open
Narration,Narrative,"his wings, and aims himself towards the window above."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,To Infinity and Beyond!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz leaps off the banister...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,and falls.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,In SLOW MOTION Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
Narration,Narrative,farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz CRASHES on the entryway floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz opens his eyes to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm
Narration,Narrative,socket.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz drops his head back in defeat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"M-o-o-om?  Mom, have you seen my"
Narration,Narrative,Sally doll?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps"
Narration,Narrative,on him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What, dear?  What was that?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nevermind.
Narration,Narrative,
DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The knob jiggles for a moment.  Suddenly, the door flies"
Narration,Narrative,"open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights,"
Narration,Narrative,standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and the rest of the junk topple over.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Oo-o-of!
Narration,Narrative,(to the hallway)
Narration,Narrative,Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz?
Narration,Narrative,Where are you?
Narration,Narrative,It's a secret mission in uncharted
Narration,Narrative,space!  Let's go!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights"
Narration,Narrative,with him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Really?  That is so-o-o interesting.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody peeks into the open doorway of...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  Her guests are
Narration,Narrative,"dolls, headless dolls, that is except for..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly"
Narration,Narrative,apron and fashionable party hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Would you like some tea, Mrs. Nesbit?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(under his breath)
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and
Narration,Narrative,pours imaginary tea with it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's so nice you could join us on
Narration,Narrative,such late notice.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody steps back into the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbit.  It"
Narration,Narrative,goes quite well with your head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further"
Narration,Narrative,down the hall.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(high voice)
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah!  Oh, Hannah!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(yelling out her room)
Narration,Narrative,Mom?
Narration,Narrative,(to the dolls)
Narration,Narrative,"Please excuse me, ladies.  I'll be"
Narration,Narrative,right back.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down
Narration,Narrative,onto the table.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and"
Narration,Narrative,walks downstairs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What is it, Mom?  Mom, where are you?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody bolts into Hannah's room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of
Narration,Narrative,it's gone.  Bye-bye!  Whoo-hoo!
Narration,Narrative,See ya!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What happened to you?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,One minute you're defending the
Narration,Narrative,whole galaxy...
Narration,Narrative,(pointing at other dolls)
Narration,Narrative,...and suddenly you find yourself
Narration,Narrative,suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie
Narration,Narrative,Antoinette and her little sisters.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The headless dolls turn and wave.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
Narration,Narrative,the table.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I think you've had enough tea for
Narration,Narrative,today.
Narration,Narrative,(helping Buzz up)
Narration,Narrative,"Let's get you out of here, Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(grabbing Woody)
Narration,Narrative,Don't you get it?!  You see the hat?
Narration,Narrative,I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
Narration,Narrative,(hysterical laughter)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Snap out of it, Buzz!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face"
Narration,Narrative,"with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody.
Narration,Narrative,Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(sober)
Narration,Narrative,I'm sorry.  You're right.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"...I'm just a little depressed,"
Narration,Narrative,that's all.  I can get through this.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, I'm a sham!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,"Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Look at me!  I can't even fly out
Narration,Narrative,of a window!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody stops short.  He looks down the hallway in the
Narration,Narrative,direction of Sid's room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to
Narration,Narrative,Andy's bedroom window.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,But -- the hat looked good.  Tell
Narration,Narrative,me the hat looked good!  The apron
Narration,Narrative,"is a bit much, it's not my color..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Out the window...Buzz, you're a"
Narration,Narrative,genius!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz
Narration,Narrative,towards Sid's room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Come on, this way!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mr. Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship.  Hamm's
Narration,Narrative,wearing Potato Head's hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Miss.  G-6.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Heh-heh.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Are you peeking?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, quit your whining and pay up."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head reaches for his ear.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the"
Narration,Narrative,nose.  C'mon!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pulling out his
Narration,Narrative,nose; nasally)
Narration,Narrative,How 'bout three out of five?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Both toys look across the way.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to
Narration,Narrative,the toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Son of a building block, it's Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hi!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(into Andy's bedroom)
Narration,Narrative,"Everyone, it's Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You're kidding?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"We're gonna get outta here, Buzz --"
Narration,Narrative,Buzz?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is not there.  Woody looks down at the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing ""bombs away"" with his"
Narration,Narrative,broken arm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, look!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Boy, am I glad to see you guys!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I knew you'd come back, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What are you doing over there?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"It's a long story, Bo.  I'll"
Narration,Narrative,"explain later.  Here, catch this!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over.  Slinky
Narration,Narrative,catches them.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I got it, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(overly excited)
Narration,Narrative,"He got it, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just"
Narration,Narrative,tie it on to something!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea!
Narration,Narrative,How about we DON'T?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey?!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head!?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Did you all take stupid pills this
Narration,Narrative,morning?!  Have you forgotten what
Narration,Narrative,he did to Buzz?  And now you want
Narration,Narrative,to let him back over here?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no!  You got it all wrong,"
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz
Narration,Narrative,is right here.  He's with me!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You are a liar!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, I'm not!"
Narration,Narrative,(to Buzz)
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz, come over here and you just"
Narration,Narrative,tell the nice toys that you're not
Narration,Narrative,dead.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker"
Narration,Narrative,on his wrist communicator.  He crumples it up and tosses it
Narration,Narrative,aside.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Andy's toys)
Narration,Narrative,Just a sec.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!  Will you get up here and
Narration,Narrative,give me a hand?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
Narration,Narrative,Woody's feet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(insincerely)
Narration,Narrative,"Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,(exploding)
Narration,Narrative,This is serious!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window.  He pretends to
Narration,Narrative,notice something out of the other toy's view.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(forced casualness)
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say"
Narration,Narrative,"""hello"" to the guys over there?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of
Narration,Narrative,"sight.  Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and"
Narration,Narrative,beyond!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(shaking the arm's hand)
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the"
Narration,Narrative,guys our new secret best-friends
Narration,Narrative,"hand shake.  Gimme five, man!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Something's screwy here.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"So, you see?  We're friends now,"
Narration,Narrative,"guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?"
Narration,Narrative,(as BUZZ)
Narration,Narrative,You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued; as himself)
Narration,Narrative,"Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back
Narration,Narrative,"the lights, Potato Head."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait just a minute.  What are you
Narration,Narrative,trying to pull?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nothing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...exposing the severed arm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all SCREAM in horror.  Rex clasps his hands to his
Narration,Narrative,mouth and turns away to BARF.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's"
Narration,Narrative,too late.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, that is disgusting."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Murderer!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No!  No, no, no, no!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You murdering dog!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, it's not what you think, I swear!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid
Narration,Narrative,"pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head drops the lights.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave!
Narration,Narrative,"You've gotta help us, please!  You"
Narration,Narrative,don't know what it's like over here!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to the other toys)
Narration,Narrative,Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Go back to your lives, citizens."
Narration,Narrative,Show's over.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the toys leave the window except Slinky.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please!"
Narration,Narrative,Please!  Listen to me!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the"
Narration,Narrative,window sill in defeat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,BROKEN TOY SOUNDS emit from behind Woody.  He turns from the
Narration,Narrative,window to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,converging all around Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the"
Narration,Narrative,desk and runs to Buzz's rescue.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Go away, you disgusting freaks!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his
Narration,Narrative,erector-set pinchers.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room,"
Narration,Narrative,crashing into the wall.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of
Narration,Narrative,mutant toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He is still alive, and you're not"
Narration,Narrative,"gonna get him, you monsters!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way"
Narration,Narrative,to...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's anger turns to confusion.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real
Narration,Narrative,when he looks to the mutants.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,But -- but they're cannibals.  We
Narration,Narrative,saw them eat those other toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's
Narration,Narrative,"last ""operation"": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl.  Their"
Narration,Narrative,heads have been taped back on the correct bodies.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutants all innocently stare at Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you
Narration,Narrative,were gonna...
Narration,Narrative,(laughs nervously)
Narration,Narrative,"...you know, eat my friend."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark"
Narration,Narrative,corners of the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's"
Narration,Narrative,wrong?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,FOOTSTEPS approach the bedroom.  Woody tries to pick up the
Narration,Narrative,"still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz,"
Narration,Narrative,you're...
Narration,Narrative,...get up...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their"
Narration,Narrative,progress is too slow.  He shakes Buzz hard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But
Narration,Narrative,don't blame me.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor
Narration,Narrative,and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid enters carrying a big box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It came!  It finally came!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(reverently)
Narration,Narrative,The big one.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He pulls out a rocket with ""THE BIG ONE"" written on it."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(reading the rocket label)
Narration,Narrative,"""Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of"
Narration,Narrative,"reach of children.""  COOL..."
Narration,Narrative,(looks around)
Narration,Narrative,"What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey,"
Narration,Narrative,where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging"
Narration,Narrative,on for dear life.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating"
Narration,Narrative,his laser.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes!  I've always wanted to put a
Narration,Narrative,spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws
Narration,Narrative,a toolbox on top of the crate.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding
Narration,Narrative,place.  Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of
Narration,Narrative,"the crate ""jail."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of
Narration,Narrative,"electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an IRREVERENT"
Narration,Narrative,"CHUCKLE, tapes Buzz to the rocket."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A flash of lightning interrupts the moment.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, no..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence.
Narration,Narrative,"Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Aw, man...!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody heaves a SIGH of relief.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Suddenly Sid's face brightens.  He turns his focus from the
Narration,Narrative,rain to the Buzzrocket.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Newscaster)
Narration,Narrative,Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of
Narration,Narrative,the shuttle has been delayed due to
Narration,Narrative,adverse weather conditions at the
Narration,Narrative,launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and"
Narration,Narrative,places it next to Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  She hands him
Narration,Narrative,his cowboy hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"I looked everywhere, honey, but all"
Narration,Narrative,I could find was your hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(groggy)
Narration,Narrative,But what if we leave them behind?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure"
Narration,Narrative,we'll find Woody and Buzz before we
Narration,Narrative,leave tomorrow.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's eyes shut.  Mom turns out the light and quietly exits
Narration,Narrative,the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"A moving box on the floor, with the words ""Andy's Toys!"""
Narration,Narrative,"scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(muffled)
Narration,Narrative,Aaaah!  I need air!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Rex pops out of the top of the box, COUGHING a packing"
Narration,Narrative,styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  Potato Head appears
Narration,Narrative,beside him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(relieved)
Narration,Narrative,Aa-a-a-a-ah!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Will you quit moving around?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so
Narration,Narrative,nervous before I travel.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,How did I get stuck with YOU as a
Narration,Narrative,moving buddy?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head drops back down into the box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(following Potato Head)
Narration,Narrative,Everyone else was picked.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
Narration,Narrative,Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, Woody, if only you could see"
Narration,Narrative,how much Andy misses you.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,THUNDER RUMBLES as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid is in bed fast asleep.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the"
Narration,Narrative,weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly
Narration,Narrative,with the rocket strapped to his back.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No reaction from Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it
Narration,Narrative,"at Buzz, striking his helmet."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  Get over here and see if you
Narration,Narrative,can get this tool box off me.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I"
Narration,Narrative,can't do this without you.  I need
Narration,Narrative,your help.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can"
Narration,Narrative,get me out of here and then I'll
Narration,Narrative,"get that rocket off you, and we'll"
Narration,Narrative,make a break for Andy's house.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's
Narration,Narrative,the difference.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall."
Narration,Narrative,You must not be thinking clearly.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, Woody, for the first time I am"
Narration,Narrative,thinking clearly.
Narration,Narrative,(looking at himself)
Narration,Narrative,You were right all along.  I'm not
Narration,Narrative,a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A
Narration,Narrative,stupid little insignificant toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being"
Narration,Narrative,a toy is a lot better than being a
Narration,Narrative,Space Ranger.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Yeah, right."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, it is.  Look, over in that"
Narration,Narrative,house is a kid who thinks you are
Narration,Narrative,"the greatest, and it's not because"
Narration,Narrative,"you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's"
Narration,Narrative,because you're a TOY!  You are HIS
Narration,Narrative,toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,But why would Andy want me?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Why would Andy want you?!  Look at
Narration,Narrative,you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any
Narration,Narrative,other toy would give up his moving
Narration,Narrative,parts just to be you.  You've got
Narration,Narrative,"wings, you glow in the dark, you"
Narration,Narrative,"talk, your helmet does that -- that"
Narration,Narrative,whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody pauses and looks at himself.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued; depressed)
Narration,Narrative,As a matter of fact you're too cool.
Narration,Narrative,I mean -- I mean what chance does a
Narration,Narrative,toy like me have against a Buzz
Narration,Narrative,Lightyear action figure?  All I can
Narration,Narrative,do is...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody pulls his own pull-string.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,There's a snake in my boots!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody bows his head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Why would Andy ever want to play
Narration,Narrative,"with me, when he's got you?"
Narration,Narrative,(pause)
Narration,Narrative,I'm the one that should be strapped
Narration,Narrative,to that rocket.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz lifts up his foot.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The signature ""ANDY"" reads through the dirt and scuff marks."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz gazes back at Woody.  A look of determination spreads
Narration,Narrative,across his face.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You"
Narration,Narrative,should get out of here while you can.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Silence.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is gone.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake.  Woody looks"
Narration,Narrative,up to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I
Narration,Narrative,thought you were --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid"
Narration,Narrative,over in that house who needs us.
Narration,Narrative,Now let's get you out of this thing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Yes Sir!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they"
Narration,Narrative,finally get it to move but it's slow progress.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(strained)
Narration,Narrative,"Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  It's the moving van.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might.  The toolbox"
Narration,Narrative,begins to move.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool
Narration,Narrative,"chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the"
Narration,Narrative,desk.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"C'mon, Buzz."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through.
Narration,Narrative,Woody drops down to the floor below.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox
Narration,Narrative,(and milkcrate) farther out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...almost
Narration,Narrative,...there
Narration,Narrative,...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and
Narration,Narrative,milkcrate topple towards him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(nervous laugh)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toolbox CRASHES right on top of Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who"
Narration,Narrative,stirs...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(in his sleep)
Narration,Narrative,I wanna ride the pony...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid does not wake.  Buzz heaves a SIGH OF RELIEF, then peers"
Narration,Narrative,over the edge of the workbench.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(punch-drunk)
Narration,Narrative,"No, I'm fine...I'm okay..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It goes off by Sid's bed.  Woody drops back under the
Narration,Narrative,toolbox and Buzz goes limp.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches"
Narration,Narrative,the door just before it closes.  As he swings the door back
Narration,Narrative,open Woody is confronted by...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody slams the door shut just in time.  Scud BARKS AND
Narration,Narrative,SCRATCHES at the door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(out of breath; to himself)
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,"
Narration,Narrative,think!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks across the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,have appeared all around the room.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Guys!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutant toys all scatter and hide.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!"
Narration,Narrative,Please!  There's a good toy down
Narration,Narrative,there and he's -- he's going to be
Narration,Narrative,blown to bits in a few minutes all
Narration,Narrative,because of me.  I've gotta save him!
Narration,Narrative,(pause)
Narration,Narrative,-- But I need your help.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No response.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the
Narration,Narrative,shadows from under the bed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Please.  He's my friend.  He's the
Narration,Narrative,only one I've got.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's
Narration,Narrative,metal bedpost.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around"
Narration,Narrative,Woody.  He kneels down into a huddle with them.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Babyface)
Narration,Narrative,Thank you.
Narration,Narrative,(to the others)
Narration,Narrative,Okay.  I think I know what to do.
Narration,Narrative,We're going to have to break a few
Narration,Narrative,"rules, but if it works, it'll help"
Narration,Narrative,everybody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,THE MOVERS cart out the last load.  A forlorn Andy clutches
Narration,Narrative,"onto Buzz's ""spaceship"" box in one hand and his cowboy hat"
Narration,Narrative,in the other.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad SIGH.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under
Narration,Narrative,his arm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(as Astronaut)
Narration,Narrative,Houston to Mission Control.  Come
Narration,Narrative,"in, Control."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,Launch pad is being constructed!
Narration,Narrative,Heh-heh.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to"
Narration,Narrative,attack anything that exits.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
Narration,Narrative,of dominoes and Scrabble tiles.  He points to it with a
Narration,Narrative,pencil as he addresses the mutants.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All right, listen up.  I need Pump"
Narration,Narrative,Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"LEGS, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps"
Narration,Narrative,forward from the crowd.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued; to Legs)
Narration,Narrative,You're with Ducky.
Narration,Narrative,(to the others)
Narration,Narrative,RollerBob and I don't move till we
Narration,Narrative,get the signal.  Clear?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutants all give an affirmative nod.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Okay, let's move!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all break.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Legs and DUCKY, a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll"
Narration,Narrative,"torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and"
Narration,Narrative,pull the face plate off the wall.  They disappear into the
Narration,Narrative,heating duct.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ducky and Legs come to an intersection.  Ducky QUACKS and
Narration,Narrative,they head down the right tunnel.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"HAND-IN-THE-BOX, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box,"
Narration,Narrative,stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob
Narration,Narrative,of the bedroom door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody hops onto ROLLERBOB, a skateboard with a soldier's"
Narration,Narrative,upper torso tied to its front.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wind the frog!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"WALKING CAR, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding"
Narration,Narrative,"up THE FROG, a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels"
Narration,Narrative,instead of legs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky
Narration,Narrative,and Legs.  They make their way towards a junction box
Narration,Narrative,sitting in the center of the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the
Narration,Narrative,coast is clear.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently,"
Narration,Narrative,their eyes fixed on Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait for the signal.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel,"
Narration,Narrative,"hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the"
Narration,Narrative,open hole.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing."
Narration,Narrative,Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination:
Narration,Narrative,the doorbell.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ducky presses it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody throws his arm down.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Go!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'll get it!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Alright, let's go."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and"
Narration,Narrative,crew out into the hallway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah walks to the front door...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I'm coming!  I'm coming!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...and opens it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Nobody's there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
Narration,Narrative,plunger.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,zooms down the stairs with Scud BARKING right behind.  The
Narration,Narrative,"Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs"
Narration,Narrative,and out the open front door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah looks back inside at Scud.  In that moment, Ducky"
Narration,Narrative,catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
Narration,Narrative,roof.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and"
Narration,Narrative,runs out onto the empty porch.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(annoyed)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can"
Narration,Narrative,"get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Stupid dog.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud smashes into the closed door and begins BARKING furiously.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
Narration,Narrative,Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
Narration,Narrative,"corner, heading straight into the kitchen."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,By now RollerBob has really picked up speed.  He shoots
Narration,Narrative,"underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair"
Narration,Narrative,"legs, straight towards..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Lean back!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a
Narration,Narrative,wheelie.  They smash through the doggie door...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,...and catapult into the bushes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the
Narration,Narrative,launchpad.  Sid is still in the toolshed.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, Mission Control...is the"
Narration,Narrative,launchpad construction complete? --
Narration,Narrative,(simulated static)
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to"
Narration,Narrative,guide wire.  We are currently
Narration,Narrative,obtaining the...ignition sticks.
Narration,Narrative,Countdown will commence momentarily.
Narration,Narrative,Stand by --
Narration,Narrative,(simulated static)
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a"
Narration,Narrative,drain pipe.  They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to toys in the bush)
Narration,Narrative,Let's go!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?"
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, oh, wait, here they are."
Narration,Narrative,Nevermind...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of
Narration,Narrative,this thing!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Shhhhhhh!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(loud whisper)
Narration,Narrative,It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!  What are you doing?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid emerges from the tool shed.  Buzz freezes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Houston, all systems are go."
Narration,Narrative,Requesting permission to launch --
Narration,Narrative,(spotting Woody)
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  How'd you get out here?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, well, you and I can have a"
Narration,Narrative,cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses
Narration,Narrative,him onto the grill of an open barbecue.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Houston, do we have permission to"
Narration,Narrative,launch? --
Narration,Narrative,(simulated static)
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You"
Narration,Narrative,are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their"
Narration,Narrative,final positions.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid lights a match.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!
Narration,Narrative,Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!
Narration,Narrative,Three!  Two!... One!...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Reach for the sky!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Huh?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  He turns to look at
Narration,Narrative,Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
Narration,Narrative,the sound emitting from his voice box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,This town ain't big enough for the
Narration,Narrative,two of us!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It's busted.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"He raises Woody up, about to throw him away --"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid stops short and looks at Woody again.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,"
Narration,Narrative,Sid Phillips.  We don't like being
Narration,Narrative,"blown up, Sid, or smashed, or"
Narration,Narrative,ripped apart...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It isn't moving.  Sid GULPS.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,W-w-w-we?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,That's right.
Narration,Narrative,(beat)
Narration,Narrative,Your toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom"
Narration,Narrative,"mutants, begin rising from the ground in ""NIGHT OF THE"
Narration,Narrative,"LIVING DEAD"" fashion."
Narration,Narrative,"The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid.  Sid is"
Narration,Narrative,too frightened to scream or move.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"From now on, you must take good"
Narration,Narrative,care of your toys.  Because if you
Narration,Narrative,"don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We"
Narration,Narrative,toys can see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,...everything.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,For a split second Woody's face comes to life.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(regular voice)
Narration,Narrative,So play nice.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and all the toys CHEER VICTORIOUSLY.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid
Narration,Narrative,rushes up to her.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys!  The toys are alive!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,N-N-Nice dolly...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in"
Narration,Narrative,Sid's face.  He SCREAMS and runs upstairs.  Hannah chases
Narration,Narrative,"after him, taunting."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want"
Narration,Narrative,to play with Sally?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys are all congratulating one another.
Narration,Narrative,"Nice work, fellahs.  Good job."
Narration,Narrative,Comin' out of the ground -- what a
Narration,Narrative,touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to"
Narration,Narrative,Sid's launchpad.  Buzz extends his hand to Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Thanks.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They shake.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Everybody say, ""Bye, house."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(depressed)
Narration,Narrative,"Bye, house."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting"
Narration,Narrative,into the van.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  The van!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to mutant toys)
Narration,Narrative,"We gotta run!  Thanks, guys."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint"
Narration,Narrative,towards the fence.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Quick!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but"
Narration,Narrative,Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before
Narration,Narrative,realizing that Buzz is missing.  He looks back to discover
Narration,Narrative,Buzz stuck in the fence.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just go!  I'll catch up!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The van begins pulling out of the driveway.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the
Narration,Narrative,fence.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the
Narration,Narrative,van driving off down the street.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz turn around.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"drives right over them.  Woody and Buzz SCREAM, ducking just"
Narration,Narrative,in time.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few"
Narration,Narrative,steps behind.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Come on!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the
Narration,Narrative,sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the
Narration,Narrative,moving truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud bears his teeth and GROWLS.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few
Narration,Narrative,paces.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,dangles off the back of the truck.  Buzz makes a leap for it
Narration,Narrative,and grabs hold.  He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"You can do it, Woody."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Whew, I made it!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale.
Narration,Narrative,Woody looks behind him to see...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(kicking Scud with
Narration,Narrative,other foot)
Narration,Narrative,"Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid"
Narration,Narrative,dog!  Down!  Down!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hold on, Woody!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I can't do it!  Take care of Andy
Narration,Narrative,for me!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout.  He grabs
Narration,Narrative,"Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  Scud YELPS, letting go"
Narration,Narrative,of Woody.  The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his
Narration,Narrative,face.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and
Narration,Narrative,Scud behind.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the"
Narration,Narrative,bumper.  He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
Narration,Narrative,lift up the heavy door.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at"
Narration,Narrative,a traffic light.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking"
Narration,Narrative,Woody with it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck"
Narration,Narrative,until he spots what he's looking for.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"with the words ""ANDY'S TOYS"" written on them in crayon."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud flings Buzz off his face.  Buzz goes tumbling under a
Narration,Narrative,"parked car.  Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to"
Narration,Narrative,get under it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the toys wince and MOAN as they cover their eyes from
Narration,Narrative,the sudden brightness.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Are we there already?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!  How'd you --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
Narration,Narrative,rummaging through the next box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys GRUMBLE IN"
Narration,Narrative,CONFUSION as they poke their heads up out of the first box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ah-hah!  There you are!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody pulls the RC Car and its remote out of the second box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  What's he doing?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car
Narration,Narrative,out onto the street.  The other toys SCREAM in horror.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,He's at it again!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud
Narration,Narrative,and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,RC's motor WHIRRS happily at the sight of Buzz.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
Narration,Narrative,cross the intersection.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pointing at Woody)
Narration,Narrative,Get him!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the toys pour out of their boxes and CHARGE on Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
Narration,Narrative,the angry mob of toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back towards the
Narration,Narrative,moving truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
Narration,Narrative,Buzz --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no!  Wait!"
Narration,Narrative,(as Rocky spins him)
Narration,Narrative,Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts
Narration,Narrative,doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(spinning)
Narration,Narrative,Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rocky throws Woody to the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,-- RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud
Narration,Narrative,giving close chase.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Pig pile!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"-- The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off."
Narration,Narrative,"Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and the RC car drive straight into it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
Narration,Narrative,halt just missing a car.  The car swerves and CRASHES into
Narration,Narrative,another car.  Soon there is a multi-car pile up that
Narration,Narrative,"encircles Scud, entrapping the dog."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on
Narration,Narrative,the other side.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and
Narration,Narrative,head for the open back.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No wait!  You don't understand!
Narration,Narrative,Buzz is out there!  We've gotta
Narration,Narrative,help him!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Toss 'im overboard!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"No, no, no, wait!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys toss him out into the road.  As the truck drives
Narration,Narrative,"off, the toys CHEER."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,So long Woody!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes
Narration,Narrative,over him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,come barreling towards him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding
Narration,Narrative,the remote).
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Well, thanks for the ride."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(pointing ahead)
Narration,Narrative,Look out!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
Narration,Narrative,that had passed over Woody earlier.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody SCREAMS and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
Narration,Narrative,"hard left, missing the tire by inches.  The RC Car moves up"
Narration,Narrative,under the car.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Now let's catch up to that truck!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody flicks a switch from ""ON"" to ""TURBO."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car speeds up towards the moving truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The toys are busy CONGRATULATING one another when Lenny, the"
Narration,Narrative,"wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and"
Narration,Narrative,Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!
Narration,Narrative,And Buzz is with him!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?!!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys rush to the edge of the open truck.  Bo picks up
Narration,Narrative,Lenny and looks through him.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,It is Buzz!  Woody was telling the
Narration,Narrative,truth!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What have we done?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Great.  Now I have guilt.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We're almost there.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Rocky!  The ramp!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side"
Narration,Narrative,"of the back.  The sign above it reads ""RAMP: UP/DOWN."""
Narration,Narrative,Rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  The ramp begins to lower.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
Narration,Narrative,right on top of them.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Look out!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
Narration,Narrative,the road.  Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
Narration,Narrative,pavement.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to other toys)
Narration,Narrative,Quick!  Hold on to my tail!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing
Narration,Narrative,Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody.
Narration,Narrative,Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab
Narration,Narrative,Slinky's hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They grab hold of one another.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"That a boy, Slink!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling"
Narration,Narrative,Slinky's front end off the ramp.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  Speed up!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Buzz)
Narration,Narrative,Speed up!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The batteries!  They're running out!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,RC's headlight eyes sag.  The car slows even more.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,As Slinky continues stretching.  The RC Car begins to weave
Narration,Narrative,side-to-side like a water skier.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her"
Narration,Narrative,sideview mirror.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then
Narration,Narrative,back out.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Molly SQUEALS with delight.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins"
Narration,Narrative,to lose his grip on Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I can't hold on much longer!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slink!  Hang on!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into"
Narration,Narrative,the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car sputters to a stop.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
Narration,Narrative,truck disappear.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(sarcastic)
Narration,Narrative,Great!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  The rocket!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The match!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put
Narration,Narrative,there earlier.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(continued)
Narration,Narrative,"Yes!  Thank you, Sid!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against"
Narration,Narrative,"RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when..."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"whizzes right over them, blowing out the match."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
Narration,Narrative,prostrate to the ground.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing"
Narration,Narrative,his helmet to block the sun from Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and"
Narration,Narrative,looks at his hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears"
Narration,Narrative,on the back of Woody's hand.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the"
Narration,Narrative,white dot hits the tip of the fuse.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody?!  What are you doing?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hold still, Buzz!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The fuse lights.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ha-ha!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.
Narration,Narrative,Rockets explo --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The RC Car rockets forward.  Speeding along the dividing
Narration,Narrative,"line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the"
Narration,Narrative,moving truck can be seen on the horizon.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out"
Narration,Narrative,on the floor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,I shoulda held on longer.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Lenny looks out the back again.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,Comin' up fast!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys run to the opening and CHEER.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and
Narration,Narrative,Woody off the RC Car.  Woody manages to continue holding
Narration,Narrative,onto RC -- but not for long.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys CHEERING turns to SCREAMING as they rush to get out
Narration,Narrative,"of the way of the oncoming ""RC rocket."""
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Take cover!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the"
Narration,Narrative,back of the truck.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ahhh!! This is the part where we
Narration,Narrative,blow up!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Not today!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket."
Narration,Narrative,The toys separate from the rocket just before it BLOWS UP.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys plummet.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(covering his eyes)
Narration,Narrative,Ah-h-h-h-h!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
Narration,Narrative,again.  Woody takes a peek.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They're flying.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,This isn't flying.  This is
Narration,Narrative,falling -- with style!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass"
Narration,Narrative,over it.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We're not aiming for the truck!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
Narration,Narrative,drop into the car.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box"
Narration,Narrative,in the back seat right next to Andy.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the
Narration,Narrative,box.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Hey!  Wow!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,What?  What is it?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(picking up the toys)
Narration,Narrative,Woody!  Buzz!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, great, you found them.  Where"
Narration,Narrative,were they?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Here!  In the car!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"See?  Now, what did I tell you?"
Narration,Narrative,Right where you left them.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Andy hugs both toys.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,They give each other a knowing wink.
Narration,Narrative,
DISSOLVE TO,Dialogue,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be"
Narration,Narrative,seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Which one can I open first?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Let's let Molly open one.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his
Narration,Narrative,binoculars.  He turns and motions back into the tree.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported
Narration,Narrative,by several green army men.  One of the soldiers turns it on.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand.
Narration,Narrative,It CRACKLES WITH STATIC.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over the monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come"
Narration,Narrative,"in, Frankincense."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the
Narration,Narrative,nightstand alongside the monitor.  They listen intently.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to the room)
Narration,Narrative,"Hey, heads up everybody!  It's"
Narration,Narrative,showtime.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody and the rest of the toys are MINGLING together like a
Narration,Narrative,typical office Christmas party.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Oh!  It's time!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The toys all stop and run towards the monitor.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
Narration,Narrative,reveal...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!
Narration,Narrative,(rubbing his neck)
Narration,Narrative,There's gotta be a less painful way
Narration,Narrative,to get my attention.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Merry Christmas, Sheriff."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched
Narration,Narrative,on a shelf dangling mistletoe.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Say, isn't that mistletoe?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Mm-hmmmmm.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and KISSES him."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
Narration,Narrative,"restless with ""excitement"" not fear."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(to Slinky)
Narration,Narrative,"Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,"
Narration,Narrative,"like a leaf-eater.  That way, I"
Narration,Narrative,"could play the, uh, dominant"
Narration,Narrative,predator.  Ha ha ha!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Slinky LAUGHS with Rex.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Quiet everyone, quiet!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Way to go, Idaho!"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,All the toys CONGRATULATE Potato Head.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Gee, I better shave."
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Potato Head whips off his moustache piece.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz.  Lipstick now
Narration,Narrative,covers Woody's face.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,"Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now"
Narration,Narrative,opening his first present --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  Nothing.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not
Narration,Narrative,"worried, are you?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(over monitor)
Narration,Narrative,I can't quite make out --
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(defensively)
Narration,Narrative,"Me?  No, no, no, no..."
Narration,Narrative,(beat)
Narration,Narrative,Are you?
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,(laughing)
Narration,Narrative,"Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly"
Narration,Narrative,get that is worse than you?!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We TRUCK OUT through the window to the EXT. as we HEAR...
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"Oh, what is it?  What is it?"
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,Wow!  A puppy!
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,We ZOOM BACK through the window to a CLOSE UP of Buzz and
Narration,Narrative,Woody.
Narration,Narrative,
Narration,Narrative,"They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and"
