# GPT_LLM_ToyStory

This repository contains a GPT-based language model trained on a **Toy Story dataset**. The model uses transformer architectures, including self-attention, multi-head attention, and feed-forward layers, to generate contextually coherent text inspired by the Toy Story universe.

## ðŸ“– Overview

We inteded to train the model to understand and generate text in the style of the beloved Toy Story characters. It uses a sequence-to-sequence modeling approach with state-of-the-art transformer techniques to create outputs that mimic the tone and dialogue of the Toy Story movies.
For the output, it saves the generated text at each milestone into a file "(milestoneX.txt)".
